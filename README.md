### Hello World!

I'm a Data Scientist and Statistical UX Researcher who passionately self-taught the art of transforming raw data into meaningful insights. With two dynamic years of professional experience under my belt, I have leveraged my skills in diverse industries such as healthcare, insurance, and architectural construction.

My expertise lies in architecting fast, scalable, end-to-end machine learning solutions. I deliver robust business analytics and formulate effective data strategies. Alongside this, I have a knack for enhancing user experiences through experimental design, A/B testing, and causal inference.
My Current Adventures 🛤️

- 🏠 Working on 'House Analytics', an intriguing project focused on Architecture-related Machine Learning.
- 🎓 Upskilling myself in JuliaLang, PyTorch Lightning, JAX, and Databricks.

### Let's Collaborate 🤝

I'm always eager to join forces on data science projects that bring about positive impact. So, if you have an idea or a project where we could synergize, don't hesitate to reach out!
