# Hey there! üëã

I'm a data scientist and AI engineer who enjoys digging into raw data and turning it into something meaningful. Over the past four years, I've worked across telecommunications, construction, and insurance, using machine learning and advanced analytics to solve real-world problems.

## A Bit About Me

- **Data Science in Action:** From building churn prediction models to fraud detection and recommendation systems, I love creating practical ML solutions.
- **Exploring Generative AI:** I'm always checking out emerging tech‚ÄîVisionLLM, GraphLLM, and beyond‚Äîto push the boundaries of what AI can do.
- **Current Focus:** Right now, I'm deep into large language models (LLMs), designing scalable systems and applications that bring these models to life.

## Projects & Involvement

- **Thai Datasets on Kaggle:** I‚Äôve been curating and cleaning Thai datasets, making them more accessible to everyone. [Check them out](https://www.kaggle.com/thaweewatboy/datasets) if you‚Äôd like to collaborate!
- **Instruction Datasets on Hugging Face:** I‚Äôve published English-Thai instruction datasets for tuning language models. Feel free to [browse and contribute](https://huggingface.co/Thaweewat).
- **OpenThaiNLP Contributor:** Proud to have contributed to [OpenThaiNLP](https://openthaigpt.aieat.or.th/released-models-version-less-than-0.1.0-beta-greater-than-16-05-23), an effort to bring Thai GPT models to the public.

## Let‚Äôs Connect ü§ù

If you‚Äôre into data science, AI engineering, or just tinkering with new ideas, I‚Äôm always up for a chat or a project. Let‚Äôs build something cool together!
