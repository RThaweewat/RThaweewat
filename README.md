# Hello World!

I'm a Data Scientist and Statistical UX Researcher who passionately self-taught the art of transforming raw data into meaningful insights. With two dynamic years of professional experience under my belt, I have leveraged my skills in diverse industries such as healthcare, insurance, and architectural construction.

My expertise lies in architecting fast, scalable, end-to-end machine learning solutions. I deliver robust business analytics and formulate effective data strategies. Alongside this, I have a knack for enhancing user experiences through experimental design, A/B testing, and causal inference.

## What I'm Up To Now 🛤️

- 🏠 Immersed in 'House Analytics', a captivating project that merges Architecture and Machine Learning.
- 🎓 Diving deep into oto-endoscopic images segmentation for my Master's degree research.
- 🌱 Continuously learning and mastering new technologies such as JuliaLang, JAX, and Databricks to stay on top of the game.

## Let's Make an Impact Together 🤝

I'm always ready and excited to collaborate on data science projects that leave a lasting, positive impression. If you have a project or an idea that could use some data magic, I'd love to hear about it!

- 💼 Currently, I am engaged in the mammoth task of cleaning up and migrating public [Thai datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/thaweewatboy/datasets) to Kaggle. If you're interested in making Thai datasets more accessible and usable, let's connect!
- 📚 I've published the multiple English-Thai instruction datasets on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Thaweewat). If you're working on instruction tuning for Language Models, do check it out!
- 💻 Proud to be a main contributor to [OpenThaiNLP](https://openthaigpt.aieat.or.th/released-models-version-less-than-0.1.0-beta-greater-than-16-05-23), a project that aims to make publicly access to Thai GPT.

Thank you for stopping by my GitHub profile! Let's code the future, together. 🚀
